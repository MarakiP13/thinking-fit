# For Educators

Some students do not struggle because they lack motivation, discipline, or ability, but because their thinking requires different conditions to complete. 
These students often synthesize internally before acting, learn deeply but non-linearly, and disengage under time pressure, early evaluation, or forced participation. 
What looks like procrastination, passivity, or resistance is frequently an interruption of thinking, not an absence of it. 
When learning is separated from performance, when pace is flexible, and when visibility is optional rather than mandatory, these students often demonstrate clarity, originality, and strong judgment. 
Supporting them does not require lowering standards. It requires adjusting the container so thinking is allowed to finish.
