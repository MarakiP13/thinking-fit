# For Managers

Some people do not underperform because they lack skill, motivation, or accountability, but because their thinking is disrupted by the way work is structured. 
These individuals often do their best work when they are allowed time to synthesize privately before acting, when expectations are clear but not prematurely binding, and when evaluation follows understanding 
rather than interrupting it. What can appear as hesitation, overthinking, or resistance is frequently a signal that thinking has not been allowed to complete. 
When pressure is reduced, autonomy over pacing is increased, and visibility is not constant, these individuals often contribute high-quality judgment, early risk detection, and long-term coherence. 
Managing them well does not require lowering standards. It requires designing conditions where clarity can emerge before execution.
