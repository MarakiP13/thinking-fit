# Thinking Fit Check

A small, static self-diagnostic for understanding how you think and cope under pressure.

This is **not** a personality test.
It does not classify traits or predict success.
It helps people choose environments that protect their intelligence instead of burning it out.

## What this is

Thinking Fit Check describes thinking styles across four dimensions that strongly affect burnout risk:

- **Commitment Sensitivity** – how strongly irreversibility and public binding affect you  
- **Reward Timing** – whether insight or completion provides the main sense of reward  
- **Pressure Dependence** – whether urgency improves performance or collapses it  
- **Integrity Load** – how draining incoherence and hypocrisy feel  

Burnout often happens when these dimensions are mismatched with fast, performative, high-urgency environments.

This tool is meant to **name the mismatch**, not “fix” the person.

## What this is not

- Not a clinical diagnostic  
- Not therapy  
- Not productivity advice  
- Not a hiring filter  
- Not a motivation tool  

It is descriptive, not prescriptive.

---

## How it works

- 16 questions
- 0–3 scale per item
- Scores are grouped by dimension
- Results explain *why* certain environments feel draining or stabilizing
- Career fit hints are based on container fit, not ability

All logic runs client-side.
No data is collected.
No analytics.
No tracking.

## Why this exists

Many intelligent people burn out not because they lack discipline or skill,
but because their thinking style is repeatedly forced into the wrong container.

This tool gives language to that experience.

## Usage

- Open `thinking-fit.html` in any browser  
- Or host it on any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
- Works offline

PRs welcome if they preserve:
- non-performative tone
- no gamification
- no leaderboards
- no scoring-as-identity

---

## Design principles

- Quiet by default  
- No urgency cues  
- No optimization pressure  
- No “improvement” framing  

If it turns into a personality label or growth hack, it has failed.
